Usage form:
[ret] = GauStu_Granger_regress(X,nlags,STATFLAG)
X d*N data, d is the dimension， and N is the time series length
nlags is the model order.

Not only that, but we've also developed a robust approach to EEG data preprocessing," In "https://github.com/Gaitxh/FCCJIA-An-adaptive-joint-CCA-ICA-method-for-ocular-artifact-removal provides a fast and robust eye electric artifact removal techniques, In the "https://github.com/Gaitxh/ATICA-An-Adaptive-EOG-Removal-Method-Based-on-Local-Density-" is also a kind of robust eye electric artifact removal techniques, It also provides a threshold calculation strategy. I hope these works can help you.
